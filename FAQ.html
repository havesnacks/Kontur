          <p>
            WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR COMMERCIAL CLIENTS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR
            NEEDS. WHETHER YOU NEED A COMPANY LOGO, ACCENT ARTWORK, OR A MIX OF
            BOTH, WE'RE HERE TO HELP. UPON INQUIRY, WE'LL TAKE MEASUREMENTS OR
            REQUEST THEM FROM YOUR CONSTRUCTION SPACE TO DETERMINE THE PROJECT
            COST. AFTER PLACING A DEPOSIT, WE'LL DESIGN CUSTOM ARTWORK TO
            COMPLEMENT YOUR SPACE, INCLUDING CONCEPTUALIZATION, MOCK-UPS, AND
            ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON YOUR FEEDBACK. ONCE YOU APPROVE THE DESIGN AND
            PLAN, IT WILL TAKE ABOUT 7-10 BUSINESS DAYS FOR THE PRODUCT TO BE
            COMPLETED AND READY FOR SHIPPING OR INSTALLATION. PLEASE SEE
            INSTALLATION INFORMATION BELOW. OUR PANELS ARE ENGINEERED WITH
            SIMPLICITY IN MIND, ENSURING MINIMAL DISRUPTION TO YOUR COMMERCIAL
            SPACE. ALL PANELS MUST BE INSTALLED BY INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS. WE
            ALSO OFFER AN OPTIONAL INSTALLATION SERVICE WITHIN THE GTA, PROVIDED
            BY OUR LICENSED CONTRACTING PARTNER. WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE A PDF WITH
            INSTALLATION DETAILS. CONTACT US FOR MORE INFORMATION.

          <p>
            THESE TERMS OF SERVICE DO NOT GIVE YOU THE RIGHTS OR PERMISSION TO
            USE/MODIFY/ALTER/ REPLICATE OR BORROW ANY OF THE PREVIOUS

            THESE UNUSED AND PREVIOUS IDEAS FOR FUTURE CONCEPTUAL AND CLIENT
            WORK. WHERE A PREVIOUSLY UNUSED IDEA/DESIGN RETAINS A SIMILAR LOOK
            AND STYLE TO THE FINISHED LOGO, WE SHALL REPURPOSE AND STYLE SO THAT
            THE END DESIGN IS SUFFICIENTLY DIFFERENT AS TO NOT CAUSE CONFLICT.
            UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED AND ARRANGED. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO
            SHOWCASE THE FINISHED PANEL AND ASSOCIATED DESIGNS IN OUR PORTFOLIO
            AND IN ANY NUMBER OF ONLINE GALLERIES/ PORTFOLIO/SHOWCASES/AWARDS AS

            POSSIBLE. HOWEVER, DEPENDING ON THE WORK COMPLETED AND OVERALL
            BUDGET, A PORTION OF THE FUNDS MAY BE RETURNED. IF WE FALL ILL, OR

            A PORTION OF THE OVERALL BUDGET WILL BE RETURNED. IN MOST CASES, THE
            COMPLETE AMOUNT WILL BE REFUNDED.
